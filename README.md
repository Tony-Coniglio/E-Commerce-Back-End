# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Summary

In this projected I created the back-end routes and models for an inventory database. This application uses Express and Sequelize to communicate with the SQL database. In my walkthrough videos (below) I demonstrate how the routes work using insomnia.

## Installation

- Clone the repository from github
- Connect to the database using mySql
- Seed the database using `node seeds/index.js`
- Run the server by using `npm run start`

## Application

This application will allow users to create products, tags, and product categories. Generally speaking, this is an inventory management tool that can help a business keep track of inventory.
